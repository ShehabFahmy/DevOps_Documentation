1. Monitoring different metrics and analytics of different machines.
2. Notification alert:
   Several outages have occurred due to high memory on the server hosting a MySql database. Operations team would like to be notified through email when the memory gets to 80% max capacity so that proactive measure can be taken.
3. Chart plotting:
   A new video upload feature has been added to the website, however there is some concerns about users uploading too large of videos. The team would like to find out at which video length the applications starts to degrade and to do this, they need a chart plotting the avg file size of upload and the average latency per request.
